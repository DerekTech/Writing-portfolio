  <h1>Query Parameters & Route Parameters (wildcards)</h1>

  <h2>Query Parameters?</h2>

  <p>Query parameters are what we use to pass in values of variables into a URL, as we can see in the following URL; <code>pizzahouse.com/pizzas?price=10</code>. The question mark denotes the start of what is referred to as a query string, which includes one or more query parameters. Here, we have one query parameter with the name "price" and value = 10.</p>

  <p>Query strings are common in marketing URLs. When a user clicks on a specific link, the parameters in the URL read where the user clicks from. For example:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">pizzahouse.com/pizzas?source=facebook&amp;campaign=half_price_promo</code></pre>

  <p>
    Here, we have two parameters separated by the ampersand sign (&). When the user clicks on the pizzahouse link, our server reads that they clicked on our half-price promo campaign link on Facebook.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, with this data, we can provide a tailored experience to the users by showing them pizzas that are up for the half-price promo. This is one of the use cases of query parameters.
    Now, let's look at how we can detect these parameters and access their values in Laravel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's assume a user goes to the URL; <code>pizzahouse.com/pizzas?name=john</code>, how do we access that information in Laravel?
  </p>

  <p>
    It's a simple process; first, we head to the pizzas route handler, because that's the URL the user visits.
    We can access any parameter by using the <code>request</code> function that takes in the name of the parameter as an argument.
    Therefore, in this case, this is how we'll access the name parameter:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">Route::get('/pizzas', function () {

    // get data from database
    $pizza = [
        ['type' => 'hawaiian', 'base' => 'cheesy crust'],
        ['type' => 'volcano', 'base' => 'garlic crust'],
        ['type' => 'veg supreme', 'base' => 'thin & crispy']
    ];

    $name = request('name');

    return view('pizzas', [
        'pizzas' => $pizza,
        'name' => $name,
    ]);

});</code></pre>

  <p>
    If we output this in the <code>pizzas.blade.php</code> folder and save, we will get the value of the parameter where we output it, on the pizzas page.
    Go to the URL <code>/pizzas/?name=john</code> on your preview page, and you'll get the name "john" as seen below:
  </p>

  <h2>Route Parameters (wildcards)</h2>

  <p>
    Route parameters are also known as wildcards in Laravel. They are similar to query parameters in that they're variables;
    however, they differ because they're without a variable name and question mark.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example: <code>pizzahouse/pizzas/1</code>; where 1 is some kind of <code>{id}</code> that would return something like details of the pizza with the ID of 1.
    If we receive a request like this in Laravel, what we'll do is detect that id (1), query the database for the pizza matching that id,
    output it in the view, and send it back to the browser for the user.
  </p>

  <p>
    How do we do that? Firstly, we'll create a new route to detect this <code>pizzahouse/pizzas/1</code> route;
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we grab the <code>{id}</code> in a function as a variable, such that whatever <code>{id}</code> sent is assigned to the variable in the function.
    Next up is using the variable to query the database for the pizza details and then sending it to the view.
    We won't be doing anything database yet; we'll do that later on in this course.
  </p>

  <p>
    So let's create a new view called <code>details</code>; we'll copy all the code from <code>pizzas.blade.php</code> into <code>details.blade.php</code>.
    But we'll delete the forEach section because we are not outputting that in this view. What we want to output is <code>{id}</code>.
  </p>

  <p>Therefore, our view should look like this when we output the <code>$id</code> variable:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">
&lt;?php
@extends('layouts.layout')

@section('content')
    &lt;div class="flex-center position-ref full-height"&gt;
        &lt;div class="content"&gt;
            &lt;div class="title m-b-md"&gt;
                Pizza List - {{ '{{$id}}' }}
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
@endsection
</code></pre>

  <p>And our new route should look like this:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">Route::get('/pizzas/{id}', function ($id) {

    // use the $id variable to query the database for a record
    return view('details', ['id' => $id]);

});</code></pre>

  <p>
    We went for <code>/pizzas/{id}</code> instead of <code>/pizzas/1</code> or any other ID because hard coding the ID will take forever.
    You can call yours whatever you want; however, <code>{id}</code> seems logical.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we save and visit <code>/pizzas/1</code> in our preview browser, this is what we should have:
  </p>

  <hr />
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> One Blade code block (<code>@extends ... @endsection</code>) was reformatted into a proper HTML-safe code block. No other content was changed.</p>
