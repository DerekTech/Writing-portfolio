  <h1>Controllers</h1>

  <p>
    If you can recall, at the start of this course, we mentioned that Laravel uses the MVC approach.
    We've already discussed the View (the "V" in MVC), but now it's time to explore another part of the puzzle: the Controller ("C").
  </p>

  <p>
    From previous modules, we know that when Laravel receives a request, the appropriate route handler takes care of it and sends a view back to the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if we receive a request for our <code>/pizzas</code> route, the function in our route handler executes (defining some data and returning the view).
    Essentially, the function that fires depends on the request received.
  </p>

  <p>
    While defining functions directly in the route file works in small projects, it can become messy in real-world scenarios with many routes and complex logic.
  </p>

  <h2>What do we do then?</h2>

  <p>
    The best approach is to create an external file to hold all our callback functions. We call this file a <strong>controller</strong>.
    A controller is a special class in Laravel where we define our route logic and then reference those functions in our route file.
  </p>

  <p>
    This makes our code cleaner, more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain. That said, we don't need a controller for every single route.
    Instead, we group related routes under a single controller. For example, all pizza-related routes (<code>/pizzas</code>, <code>/pizzas/{id}</code>) would go under a <code>PizzaController</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>How can we create a controller?</h2>

  <p>
    There are two ways: manually or using Artisan (Laravel’s CLI tool).
  </p>

  <p>
    Open your terminal, navigate to the <code>pizzahouse</code> directory, and run:
  </p>

  <pre><code>php artisan make:controller PizzaController</code></pre>

  <p>
    This follows Laravel's naming convention: "Pizza" starts with a capital letter, and "Controller" is appended.
  </p>

  <p>
    Go to <code>app/Http/Controllers</code> to find your new <code>PizzaController</code> class, which should look like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PizzaController extends Controller
{
    //
}
</code></pre>

  <h2>Defining Route Functions in the Controller</h2>

  <p>
    Now we’ll move the logic from our <code>/pizzas</code> route into this controller.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">class PizzaController extends Controller
{
    public function index() {
        $pizza = [
            ['type' =&gt; 'hawaiian', 'base' =&gt; 'cheesy crust'],
            ['type' =&gt; 'volcano', 'base' =&gt; 'garlic crust'],
            ['type' =&gt; 'veg supreme', 'base' =&gt; 'thin &amp; crispy']
        ];

        $name = request('name');

        return view('pizzas', [
            'pizzas' =&gt; $pizza,
            'name' =&gt; $name,
        ]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The method name <code>index</code> is a naming convention for routes like <code>/pizzas</code>.</p>

  <h3>For <code>/pizzas/{id}</code>:</h3>

  <pre><code class="language-php">public function show($id) {
    return view('details', ['id' =&gt; $id]);
}
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> When we define functions in a controller, they are called <em>actions</em>.</p>

  <h2>Updating Routes to Use the Controller</h2>

  <p>
    Remove the route callback functions from <code>web.php</code> and replace them with controller references:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-php">Route::get('/pizzas', 'PizzaController@index');
Route::get('/pizzas/{id}', 'PizzaController@show');</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>index</code> and <code>show</code> are common naming conventions used by Laravel developers, but you can use other names if you prefer.</p>

  <p>
    If you save and preview your site, you won’t see any functional change—just a better organized code structure.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Controllers are the place to define the logic that powers your routes. As we continue in this course, we’ll use them more frequently and in more advanced scenarios.
