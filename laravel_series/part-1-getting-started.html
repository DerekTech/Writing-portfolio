  <h1>What is Laravel?</h1>

  <p>Laravel is an open-source PHP framework that makes building websites and apps easier. It works well with MySQL databases and is easy to connect.</p>

  <p>In addition to providing you with the tools to build a secure website, Laravel comes with a host of features that will make your web development task faster. Saving you a lot of time, especially if you're building your website from scratch.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <p>Laravel offers so many interesting features, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blade, a templating engine for creating dynamic HTML pages</li>
    <li>An easy-to-setup authentication system</li>
    <li>Eloquent Models that eliminate the need to write a load of SQL to query a MySQL database</li>
    <li>An MVC (Model, View, & Control) approach</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The MVC approach refers to how you structure your code: the <strong>model</strong> represents your data logic, the <strong>view</strong> controls what the user sees (HTML), and the <strong>controller</strong> connects both.</p>

  <p>We will take an in-depth look into this approach later. For now, here's what the website we'll build looks like:</p>

  <p><strong>Pizza House</strong> is a simple pizza delivery website where users can order pizza, and customer service can manage orders via a backend dashboard.</p>

  <p>This will be built using Laravel, the Laravel Auth system, and MySQL.</p>

  <h2>Who Is This Course For?</h2>

  <p>This course is for developers with basic knowledge of PHP, HTML, and CSS. It’s not a PHP beginner course, but it’s perfect if you're looking to learn Laravel 6 from the ground up.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>Laravel needs a proper development environment. Start by installing <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> which includes MySQL and PHP.</p>

  <h3>Step 1:</h3>
  <p>Install Composer from <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">getcomposer.org</a>.</p>

  <h3>Step 2:</h3>
  <p>After installing, run:</p>
  <pre><code>composer -V</code></pre>
  <p>This should return the Composer version. If not, reinstall.</p>

  <h3>Step 3:</h3>
  <p>Run:</p>
  <pre><code>composer global require laravel/installer</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 4:</h3>
  <p>Create your Laravel project in your documents directory:</p>
  <pre><code>cd documents
cd laravel
laravel new pizzahouse</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 5:</h3>
  <p>Navigate into the project and open with VS Code or another editor:</p>
  <pre><code>cd pizzahouse</code></pre>

  <p>In VS Code, go to <code>Terminal → New Terminal</code> to access the project terminal.</p>

  <p>Start Laravel's development server:</p>
  <pre><code>php artisan serve</code></pre>

  <p>Open <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code> in your browser to see the default Laravel homepage.</p>
